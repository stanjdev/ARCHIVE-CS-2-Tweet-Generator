Stochastic Sampling, 
Accumulate word count through list
where a uniform random number splits it

Distillation (values of)
fenceposts, denoting where the certain words occur

If I roll a 3, ask "what is number greater than and what's the next fencepost?"


1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
|       | | | |
one     fish, etc..

choose a random number, then iterate the list and check if the random number is less than current fence post. 

3 less than 0? no

3 less than 5? yes. stop

7 less than


Generate a dart to throw on the number line, and return a word.
randint(1, 8) hits only the fence posts.

random.random could do floating point. like 1.3, 7.8

random.uniform(0, 8)
- returns floating point values, that don't hit the outer fence posts.


loop through object, make a list writing out how many times each word appears, then throw a dart.
